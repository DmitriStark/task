Section 1
---------
The purpose of this section is to check the UI capabilities. (HTML and CSS)

The test is to create a responsive HTML page that looks exactly like "screen1.png".
(Responsive = it should change the layout in case of mobile web).

* No frameworks are allowed (no bootstrap) - you should use pure html and css.
* The 2 graphs of "orders" and "Transactions WorldWide" should be static images that scraped from "screen1.png".
* The Bars of "Total Orders in period", "Orders in last month", "Monthly income from orders" should be implemented by you.
* the html should be responsive (fit for mobile as well).

The output of this step is: html and css files.

Please remember that the execution time is being measured.

Good Luck!
