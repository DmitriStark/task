Section 2
---------
The Purpose of this section is to deal with some server side logic:

for that please use php, with the lavarel framework (https://laravel.com/) and mysql:

write a server side api that loads data from mysql.
1. Add a login screen (html screen) that will invoke the login api in the server side.

POST /login
json body {user,password}

returns 200 in case of success and 401 in case that the user and password do not match in db.

in case of successful login, redirect to the /dashboard page (the page that you built in section 1).

2. the dashboard will load the data of the messages from the server side.

GET /messages
will retrieve the data from the messages table.


DB tables:

users:
user
password

messages:
message_title
message_body
message_time


* The output of this step is the api server written in php, html, css files.
* please include all the relevant files
